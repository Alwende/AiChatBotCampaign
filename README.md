# AI Chatbot for Presidential Campaign

The AI Chatbot for the Presidential Campaign is designed to reach out to voters through messages, live blogs on social media, analyze voting patterns, predict voter turnout, and identify stronghold areas. The chatbot will also promote the campaign agenda and engage with voters to increase support.

## Main Components

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
   - Use NLP to understand and respond to voter queries.
   - Implement sentiment analysis to gauge voter sentiment.

2. **Machine Learning for Prediction:**
   - Analyze voting patterns and predict voter turnout.
   - Identify stronghold areas based on historical data.

3. **Social Media Integration:**
   - Integrate with social media platforms to post live blogs and messages.
   - Engage with voters through social media channels.

4. **Campaign Agenda Promotion:**
   - Use the chatbot to promote the campaign agenda and key messages.
   - Provide information about the candidate's policies and achievements.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python:** Programming language for implementing the project.
- **NLTK/Spacy:** Libraries for natural language processing.
- **Scikit-learn:** Library for machine learning.
- **Tweepy:** Library for interacting with the Twitter API.
- **Facebook SDK:** Library for interacting with the Facebook API.
- **Flask/Django:** Web framework for building the chatbot interface.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You also need to install the required libraries. You can install the libraries using pip:

Project Implementation
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import spacy

# Download NLTK data
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

# Initialize sentiment analyzer
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Load Spacy model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(text)
    return sentiment

def process_text(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    return [(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_, token.tag_, token.dep_, token.shape_, token.is_alpha, token.is_stop) for token in doc]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_text = "The president's policies have greatly improved the economy."
    sentiment = analyze_sentiment(sample_text)
    processed_text = process_text(sample_text)
    print("Sentiment Analysis:", sentiment)
    print("Processed Text:", processed_text)

    2. Machine Learning for Prediction
        import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    
    def load_data(file_path):
        data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
        return data
    
    def train_model(data):
        X = data.drop('voter_turnout', axis=1)
        y = data['voter_turnout']
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
        return model, accuracy
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        data_file = "path/to/voting_data.csv"
        data = load_data(data_file)
        model, accuracy = train_model(data)
        print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)
    3. Social Media Integration
            import tweepy
        from facebook import GraphAPI
        
        # Twitter API credentials
        twitter_api_key = "your_twitter_api_key"
        twitter_api_secret_key = "your_twitter_api_secret_key"
        twitter_access_token = "your_twitter_access_token"
        twitter_access_token_secret = "your_twitter_access_token_secret"
        
        # Facebook API credentials
        facebook_access_token = "your_facebook_access_token"
        
        def post_to_twitter(message):
            auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(twitter_api_key, twitter_api_secret_key, twitter_access_token, twitter_access_token_secret)
            api = tweepy.API(auth)
            api.update_status(message)
        
        def post_to_facebook(message):
            graph = GraphAPI(access_token=facebook_access_token)
            graph.put_object(parent_object='me', connection_name='feed', message=message)
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            campaign_message = "Join us in supporting the president's re-election campaign! #Vote2027"
            post_to_twitter(campaign_message)
            post_to_facebook(campaign_message)    

            Campaign Agenda Promotion

                if topic in campaign_agenda:
                    return jsonify({topic: campaign_agenda[topic]})
                else:
                    return jsonify({"error": "Topic not found"}), 404
